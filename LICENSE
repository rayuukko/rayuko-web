Rayuko's Super Awesome License

(C) Rayuko 2020


1. Do whatever the fuck you want, I don't really care, except:

2. If you put malicious code into anything with this license and give it to people so their PC's get infected I will fucking murder you

3. Eat shit asshole, fall off your horse

4. If you want to modify anything with this license you aren't fucking allowed to change the license to something else.

5. If anything with this license fucks up your computer, that's on you, don't come crying to me for help.
5a. This only applies if it wasn't designed to fuck up your computer. If it was, that's not on you.
